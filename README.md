Description: A chat room application for UNIX. Users can create and host a room, and join to chat in real time.

Implementation approach: Start small by creating a chat room application
with a server and host with IRC. Expand later by creating our own protocol and/or GUI.

Risk Management: Since there are existing protocols and making the base chat application should be easy,
the risk management is to have a working product that is simple and reliable before moving into anything
that is remotely complex. If we cannot finish the complex features, we will have a working product underneath.
